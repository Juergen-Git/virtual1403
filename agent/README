Virtual 1403
============

https://github.com/racingmars/virtual1403

This is the Virtual 1403 Agent, which connects to Hercules to receive print
jobs from mainframe operating systems and either generates PDFs in a local
output directory, or sends the print jobs to an online service to email you
PDFs.

To use Virtual 1403, edit the config.yaml file to point to your Hercules
sockdev printer and configure choose local or online mode. If using online
mode, create and log in to your account to retrieve the correct configuration
settings for your account.

After your configuration file is correct, simply run the virtual1403
executable and print to the sockdev printer device from your mainframe.

For more information about configuring, see
https://1403.bitnet.systems/docs/setup

virtual1403 is developed in collaboration with Moshix
(https://github.com/moshix/), and the greenbar paper design is based on photos
he provided of real 1403 printouts he has.

Font conversion notes
---------------------

If you receive error messages when trying to load your custom font, you can
try to convert it to a format supported by the PDF library using FontForge. If
you are a Linux or Mac user, ensure the fontforge command is available on your
system, and create the following script
(<http://www.stuermer.ch/blog/convert-otf-to-ttf-font-on-ubuntu.html>):


    #!/usr/bin/fontforge
    # Quick and dirty hack: converts a font to truetype (.ttf)
    Print("Opening "+$1);
    Open($1);
    Print("Saving "+$1:r+".out.ttf");
    Generate($1:r+".out.ttf");
    Quit(0);

Make the script executable (chmod +x convertfont.sh), and run it on the font
file (./convertfont.sh my-font-file.otf) to create a TrueType version that
should work.
